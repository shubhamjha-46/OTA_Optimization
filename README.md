# OTA_Optimization

- The codes above is intended to implement the simulations relevant to the paper ["Fundamental limits of over-the-air optimization: Are analog schemes optimal?"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9782686). 

- The intitial baseline code for this project is taken from [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py), and thereby, credits for that should be given to its original contributors.
